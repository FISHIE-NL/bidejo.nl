<h1>Please read!</h1>
<p>I am working on this site alone. it will be a site for my mom where she can put her creations on. <br>
I am doing this at my own pace, and in my own way. </p>
<h2>But you could help!</h2>
<p>I am not the best at coding. I know the basics, some advanced stuff, but not that much. <br>
If you notice some mistakes, or things to make it easier, grab the code, edit it, test it. if it works, you can hit me up! <br>
If it works for me too, I'll include your code.</p>
